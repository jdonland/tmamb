## To Mock a Mockingbird

*To Mock a Mockingbird and Other Logic Puzzles: Including an Amazing Adventure in Combinatory Logic* is a book by the mathematician and logician Raymond Smullyan. It contains many nontrivial recreational puzzles of the sort for which Smullyan is well known. It is also a gentle and humorous introduction to combinatory logic and the associated metamathematics, built on an elaborate ornithological metaphor.

Chapters 1-8 contain a variety of more-or-less traditional logic puzzles, some very easy and some very tricky. We encourage you to try them, but our focus will be on the second half of *TMAMB*, which is about ~~combinatory logic~~ birds.

The book can be purchased or otherwise obtained online. You may also be able to borrow the book from your public or academic library, or from another member of this group. The group Discord server contains paraphrased versions of each problem for reference, but Smullyan's amusing prose and interesting elaborations are well worth reading.

## Reading Group

This group exists to encourage and assist interested parties in working their way through Chapters 9-25 of *TMAMB*. The book contains solutions, but in order to avoid becoming over-reliant on them, readers can instead discuss their solutions with, or solicit hints from, other members of the group. 

The schedule below divides Chapters 9-25 of *TMAMB* into weekly chunks each requiring roughly the same amount of effort to solve.
