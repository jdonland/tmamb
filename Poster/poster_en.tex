\emph{To Mock a Mockingbird and Other Logic Puzzles: Including an Amazing Adventure in Combinatory Logic} is a book by the mathematician and logician Raymond Smullyan. It contains many nontrivial recreational puzzles of the sort for which Smullyan is well known. It is also a gentle and humorous introduction to combinatory logic and the associated metamathematics, built on an elaborate ornithological metaphor.
